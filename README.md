## Introduction
In this Web Scraping project, we are Scraping a recruitment job site to collect information about job opportunities 
this project is done by using Python and some libraries like  Helium and BeautifulSoup 
the website provides a lot of useful information that can be used to make an analysis for a better understanding of the market and to make 
some decisions like what domain should I work for what is the average salary ETC...

Some of the information scraped :


- ```Role title```

- ```Company name```

- ```Company industry```

- ```Company headquarter```

- ```Location of job```

- ```Salary```

- ```Skills and tools```

- ```Post time```

- ```Collect date```

- ```Experience needed```

- ```Career level```

- ```Education level```

## Setting Up the environment
I wrote this script using Python on Jupyter Notebook so you can take the script and work with your own or you can follow my steps by setting the following 

1- Pyhton environment
You would need to install the following libraries
- [BeautifulSoap](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-beautiful-soup)
- [Helium](https://selenium-python-helium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
- Pandas
  
2- Web Driver

In this script, we have used the **ChromeDriver** so before running the Code you should have a suitable version of Chrome WebDriver corresponding to the version of Chrome browser you have and you can find and download this from [ChromeDriver Page](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

## Clarification

The following script is used to scrap data that already exists publically for any user
the script does not harm the website by making or putting much volume of requests on the page 
This project is used for personal usage and for educational purposes for everyone
